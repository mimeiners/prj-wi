# Interface Management

The interface allows the Kicker to communicate with another device. By design, this other device is the PC which controlls the AuVAReS drone. The interface searches for a connection and controlls the connection's status once it is esstablished. Through the interface, the patner device can send keywords which interact with the current status of the host and the other way around.

The interface is defined in the file LVL2_interface.py and also has functions and definitions in LVL3_classes.py . LVL2_interface controlls the connection status, listens for keywords and interprets all incoming messages. If a keyword is detected a function inside this file is called which includes the appropiate reaction to a keyword (e.g setting certain status flags). Sending messages aswell as the connection status flag and finding a connection are defined in LVL3_classes.py . Sending messages and the connection status flag are needed
